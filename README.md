# Text Summarization

With the rise of Deep Learning models, many have sought to implement it in real world scenarios -- Digital assistants, computer vision, fraud detection etc. In our case, I decided to delve into the world of Deep learning but attempting to use in for Text Summarization.

This little project could not have been possible without the help of my mentor, Teck Wu! Special thanks to the Girls In Tech (GIT) team for organizing this summer programme for us tech girlies. :-)

My motivation for choosing to proceed with text summarization using Deep Learning was to understand Neural Networks a little more. Along the way, I also picked up new knowledge on the different types of NNs availble, like bidrectional LSTM models, and coming across various language models like BERT and ...
