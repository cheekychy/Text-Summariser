              "6510   i  bought  this  dog  food  because  the  bag  showed  pictured  of  veggies  and  chunks  of  meat and  with  a name  like beneful i  thought  i was  purchasing  a nutritious  brand  of  dog  food my  dogs  did  eat  this  food but  after  reading  the  ingredients  i completely  regret  purchasing  it  and  feel  just  awful  for  feeding  it  to  my  dogs the  first  three  ingredients  are  ground  yellow  corn chicken  by product  meal and  corn  gluten  meal how  disgusting  is  that the  main  ingredient  is  a corn  filler one  thing  my  vet  told  me  a while  back  that  i never  forgot when  you  eat  corn what  comes  out  of  the  other  end the  same  thing  happens  with  dogs basically dogs  cannot  digest  corn it  is  just  a filler  and  causes  them  to  actually  eat  more  to  feel  full poop  out  more and  retain  less  nutrients the  only  meat  in  beneful  at  all  is  a by product its  not  even  a real  meat by products  are  the  stuff  leftover  once  all  the  actual  meat  is  harvested we  are  talking  beaks chicken  feet eyeballs even  chicken  poop i  would  not  recommend  this  product  to  anyone for  any  reason ever it  is  an  absolutely  awful  dog  food i  cannot  believe  the  pictures  of  veggies  and  full  chunks  of  meat  on  the  bag  can  be  allowed  to  be  on  the  packaging  of  such  a disgusting  product it  is  very  misleading  and  should  be  considered  false  advertising i recommend  to  stay  far  away  from  beneful and  most  purina  products when  purchasing  a dog  food the  most  important  thing  to  consider  is  the  first  3 ingredients just  make  sure  those  first  three  are  decent  ingredients  that  you  would  eat  yourself now  that  i know  what  to  look  for i  usually  buy  my  pets  all  natural organic  foods  such  as  blue  buffalo halo  or  wellness                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

              "31632  claxton  dark  fruitcake  has  been  a holiday  tradition  in  our  family  since  the  mid  1950 i  ordered  it  directly  from  the  company  this  year  and  when  i served  it  at  thanksgiving my  guests  and  i thought  i must  have  been  fooled  by  a counterfeit  website  just  claiming  to  sell  claxton  fruitcakes it  was  at  best  40 fruits  and  nuts  and  consisted  of  a gummy  light  colored cake i  emailed  the  company  and  expressed  my  disappointment after  several  emails  back  and  forth  and  after  today  talking  to  one  of  the  owners they  assured  me  that  it  was  the  original  dark  recipe in  reading  the  ingredients i  noticed  that  corn  syrup sugar  and  high  fructose  corn  syrup  were  listed  after  flour  which  was  the  4th  ingredient at  the  very  end  were  listed  molasses spices  and  3 artificial  food  dyes high  fructose  corn  syrup  was  not  widely  available  until  the  mid  1970  to  mid  1980 so  i am  not  sure  how  it  was  one  of  the  original  ingredients all  of  the  people  i talked  to  seemed  to  have  the  attitude  that  i was  so  stupid  that  i could  not  possibly  be  observing  what  i had  correctly although  they  offered  to  send  replacements  if  i returned  it  at  my  own  expense they  told  me  that  what  i would  receive  would  be  identical  to  what  i have one  of  the  owners  informed  me  that  they  had  received  zero  complaints  this  year i am  grieving  the  loss  of  an  almost  55  year  tradition but  the  other  4 cakes  are  now  in  the  trash                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
              "32405  the  caribou  blend  k cups  have  fulfilled  our  household  need  for  a plain  old  cup  of  coffee  in  the  morning  that  is  not  anything  fancy but  still  gets  the  job  done we  were  searching  for  a blend  that  was  smooth  and  flavorful  while  still  being  easy  to  drink  and  mild i  particularly  like  medium  roasts  and  i do  not  care  for  a coffee  with  a lot  of  acidity  and  a bitter  aftertaste so  this  one  fits  the  bill the  only  downside  to  this  k cup  is  that  the  aroma it  was  not  the  most  appetizing  after  the  first  cup  was  brewed but  it  made  up  for  that  in  taste this  is  not  a point  that  really  bothers  me but  i could  see  it  being  a downside  for  some  people when  i brew  this  blend  on  my  way  out  the  door i  often  throw  in  some  french  vanilla  creamer  and  it  is  my  perfect  morning  caffeine  kick so  far  this  is  the  best  average  blend  we  have  tried we  are  open  to  others  but  until  we  find  something  better we  are  sticking  with  the  caribou  blend                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
